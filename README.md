# Glasses Classification

## Train

You can find train script and logs in notebooks/glasses-modeling.   

I train in the Kaggle platform with notebooks because I don't have my own instance with GPU.   

- As you can see from notebook's logs inference time is less than 10ms on Tesla P100.
- The model weighs ~400 kb

I use dataset generated by GAN. [Dataset link](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffheaton/glasses-or-no-glasses). It contains so clear faces on all frames. I try to use augmentations to create the dataset more realistic and similar to production faces.


## Improvements

- I would revise the 3 mb limitation on the weight of the model. For example, there is a good option to use a pretrained MobileNetV2 (~10 mb).
- It might be worth looking at the distillation models. But since my custom small model gives a good score, I think this is not the main direction of development.
- It is worth finding a good dataset that looks more like real data.
- I don't really like the idea of building another model to determine the position of the face, because I think that the end-to-end approach will solve the problem completely.

## Deploy

### Mian script

You can simple build and run the docker container to see the result.

```bash
> docker build -t glasses_classification_pipeline -f app_main.Dockerfile .

> docker run -v <full_path>/with_glasses/:/app/images/ glasses_classification_pipeline
